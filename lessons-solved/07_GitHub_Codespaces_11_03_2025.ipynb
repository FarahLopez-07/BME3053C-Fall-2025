        "\n",
        "Bash is a powerful command-line interface that allows you to interact with your operating system. In your Codespace, you can use Bash to navigate files, run programs, and execute Git commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Bash stands for \"Bourne Again SHell\" and is an improved version of the original Bourne Shell (sh)\n",
        "* It's the default shell in most Linux distributions and macOS (pre-Catalina)\n",
        "* Bash supports scripting, allowing you to automate tasks with scripts\n",
        "* It provides features like command history, tab completion, and command aliases\n",
        "* Bash uses environment variables to store system and user-defined settings\n",
        "* You can combine commands using pipes (|) and redirections (>, >>, <)\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Common Bash Symbols and Their Meanings:\n",
        "  * `~` (Tilde): Represents the home directory of the current user\n",
        "    * Example: `cd ~` (navigates to your home directory)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `/` (Forward Slash): Directory separator in file paths\n",
        "    * Example: `/usr/local/` (absolute path to the local directory)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `.` (Single Dot): Refers to the current directory\n",
        "    * Example: `./script.sh` (runs script.sh from the current directory)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `..` (Double Dot): Refers to the parent directory\n",
        "    * Example: `cd ..` (moves up one directory level)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `*` (Asterisk): Wildcard that matches any number of characters\n",
        "    * Example: `ls *.txt` (lists all files with .txt extension)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `?` (Question Mark): Wildcard that matches exactly one character\n",
        "    * Example: `ls file?.txt` (matches file1.txt, fileA.txt, but not file10.txt)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `>` (Greater Than): Redirects output to a file (overwrites)\n",
        "    * Example: `echo \"hello\" > file.txt`\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `>>` (Double Greater Than): Redirects output to a file (appends)\n",
        "    * Example: `echo \"world\" >> file.txt`\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `|` (Pipe): Sends the output of one command as input to another\n",
        "    * Example: `ls -la | grep \"file\"` (lists files and filters for \"file\")\n",
        "\n",

        "    * Example: `long_process &`\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `&&` (Double Ampersand): Executes the second command only if the first succeeds\n",
        "    * Example: `mkdir folder && cd folder`\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `;` (Semicolon): Separates multiple commands on the same line\n",

        "\n",
